A. Leadership:

1. Leadership structure:

Cameron Marsh will be the team leader

2. Decision-making policy:

All decision making will require a consensus from the entire group

3. Who is the team Recorder and who is Manager/Maintainer of all required turn-ins?

Everyone in the group will collectively serve as a recorder when the task can be completed via google docs (e.g. everyone in the group having access and contributing to user stories). However when everyone in the group cannot all access the same document Blake Niebrugge will be the team's official recorder. 

Cameron Marsh as team leader will be responsible for managing all required turn-ins unless otherwise specified and agreed to by the rest of the team.

4. Day, time, and place for regular team meetings:

Meeting times will be determined on a weekly basis in order to adjust for group members changing schedules and the amount of work that needs to be done for that week.

5. Usual method of communication: 

We have two group chats via both Imessage and discord that we will use for communication. Phone numbers and emails are also listed here in the team contract if needed.
 
B. Team Procedures:

1. Method for setting and following meeting agendas:

The group will work together in order to set the weekly agenda. The agenda for the week will be set on Tuesdays after class. Team members will be notified/reminded of meetings by the team leader but there will also be a collective effort to ensure everyone is present for meetings. The team leader will also be responsible for ensuring that the team follows the set agenda during all team meetings.

2. Procedures in the absence of a team member:

The team will still meet with one member absent if that member has a reason for missing that the other two members agreed was valid and that members presence in the meeting is not essential. However the goal is to have all members present at all meetings.

C. Team Participation:

1. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:
All tasks will be agreed upon at weekly meetings. It is unavoidable that tasks will not always be divided completely evenly but if one member's task is harder than others the following week the other two group members will go out of their way to take on some extra work to keep the distribution of tasks as even as possible.

2.  Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members:

We will work together to resolve disagreements rather than burying them.
We will look to new ideas for what will work, not what is wrong.
We will help each other be right not wrong.
We will speak positively about the team at every opportunity, not negatively.
We will look for solutions to problems that come up rather than finding fault.
We want all members to feel good about the team process.

D. Consequences of breach of contract:

Policies for handling infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:
If a member of the group is not fulfilling the obligations of the team contract a meeting will be held to determine the cause of the member not fulfilling his obligations. Then appropriate action will be taken in the form of either rewriting the contract to newly agreed upon terms or meeting with Professor Liffiton to discuss the issue with an outside perspective.

Policies for handling persistent infractions:
There will be a lot of room for grace however if one member of the group is consistently not doing his share of the work and continues to not do his share after speaking with the other members. The other members can report this behavior to Professor Liffiton.
